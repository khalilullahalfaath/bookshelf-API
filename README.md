# Bookshelf API

The Bookshelf API is a RESTful API that allows users to manage a collection of books. This API provides essential functionality to store, retrieve, update, and delete books using HTTP requests. Built using Node.js with Hapi framework, the API runs on port 9000.

## Features

The Bookshelf API offers the following features:

- **Book Storage**: Users can store book data by making a POST request to the API. The API expects a JSON object with the following properties:
  - `name` (string): The name of the book.
  - `year` (number): The year of publication.
  - `author` (string): The name of the book's author.
  - `summary` (string): A summary or description of the book.
  - `publisher` (string): The name of the book's publisher.
  - `pageCount` (number): The total number of pages in the book.
  - `readPage` (number): The number of pages the user has read.
  - `reading` (boolean): Indicates whether the user is currently reading the book.

- **Book Retrieval**: Users can retrieve a list of all books in the bookshelf by sending a GET request to the API. The API responds with an array of book objects, each containing the book's details. The following query parameters are supported:

  - `name` (string, optional): Filters the books by name. Case-insensitive. Example: `/books?name=dicoding` returns books with names containing "dicoding".
  - `reading` (number, optional): Filters the books by reading status. Set to `0` to retrieve books that are not being read (reading: false), and `1` to retrieve books that are being read (reading: true). If not provided, all books will be returned.
  - `finished` (number, optional): Filters the books by finished status. Set to `0` to retrieve books that are not finished (finished: false), and `1` to retrieve books that are finished (finished: true). If not provided, all books will be returned.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.
3. Start the API server by running `npm run start` or `node start` in the terminal.
4. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:9000`.
